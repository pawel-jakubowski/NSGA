Non-Dominated Sorting Algorithm as Bicriterial Optimization Method with constraints

## Features
* Solving bicriterial optimization problem with constraints (NSGA-II)
* Processing of two goal functions with up to 5 variables as string ('f(x1,x2,x3,x4,x5)')
* Allows to define up to 5 constraints
* Plots expression and Pareto-optimized solution vector
